1. After analyzing all the time series data,what we know so far is that most of these are shit,there is absolutely no need for data other than All Equity funds.

2. Scrape site to find all the "All Equity" funds.

3. Now these funds are organised by sectors,see if one can compare between sectors,probably can since
these are open ended.So if,let's say one wants to make a profit out of this thing so one can compare
between these(probbaly).

4. Why these 34.do results have to be based mostly on these.There are many more funds here,

5. Risk is specified over a particular time interval, so comapring mutual funds should also be compared over a time period.

6. we can combine funds to get an optimal portfolio


Complaints/Doubts Regarding PS :-

1. We are required to compare the performance of the Fund Houses.Now a fund house has different schemes of varying categories(Large Cap,Small & Mid Cap etc.).So the question arises that should we compare the fund houses by category or as a whole.The preceding question is important since these Funds are fundamentally different and so it would make less sense to compare between two funds of different categories.If we need to compare the Mutual Fund houses as a whole,are we allowed to determine our own metric to average the performance across categories.This further creates a problem of how to average the different fund categories to arrive at a single measure for the Fund house.

2.For the schemes given(34 of these) , we have certain additonal data , so should greater importance be placed on these over the rest of the funds while arriving at final result?

3. We can compare schemes/fund houses over a specified time frame.The results will be different over different frames,how much importance should we place on this fact or would a average comparision over the entire time frame(5 years) be good?
