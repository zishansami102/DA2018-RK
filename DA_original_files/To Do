1. After analyzing all the time series data,what we know so far is that most of these are shit,there is absolutely no need for data other than All Equity funds.

2. Scrape site to find all the "All Equity" funds.

3. Now these funds are organised by sectors,see if one can compare between sectors,probably can since
these are open ended.So if,let's say one wants to make a profit out of this thing so one can compare
between these(probbaly).

4. Why these 34.do results have to be based mostly on these.
